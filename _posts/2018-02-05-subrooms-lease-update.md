## What do the figures look like in 2016/17

Last year [we looked at the figures behind plans to sell of the Stroud Subscription Rooms](http://stroudinvestigates.co.uk/subrooms/2017/11/21/financial-discrepancies-at-the-subrooms.html). Now that [the sale process has been cancelled](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-42249931), and a new process to lease the venue for 30 years has started, financial figures for the Subscription Rooms in 2016/17 are available on the Stroud District Council Website.

Whilst these suffer many of the same presentation problems that we pointed out last year, they do allow us to update a summary of Subs Room finances. 

Adding in the [2016/17 financial data](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/media/558052/sub-rooms-financial-data.pdf) published as part of the [invitation for bids on the lease](https://www.stroud.gov.uk/sport-leisure-parks/events-and-things-to-do/subscription-rooms/subrooms-review/2018/30-year-lease-invitation-to-bid) we can see that the trend of rising expenditure and loss was reversed last year - whilst income was up.

When you take out the capital (building depreciation) and support charges (council overheads) which we don't believe constitute real potential savings that the Council could realise, you get a figure showing the Subscription Rooms cost in 2016/17 to the budget was around £204,000 - over 50% lower than the £415,000 cost that was being quoted at the start of this whole process.
